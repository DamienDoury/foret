*Life simulator*

*July - August 2010*

First graphical project I made! I learnt C++ with this project.
Pretty much everything was challenging in this project.
Unfortunately, I never finished this project. This is just a demo. 
Maybe I'll finish it someday because I like my idea.

The goal of this project was to create a life simulator.
I just made:
- Trees
  - Reproduction (only 1 tree needed)
  - Spreading
  - Death.
  
- Animals
  - free movement of the creatures
  - hunger system
  - a proper memory for each single creature
  - when the creature is hungry, she's looking for the nearnest tree she saw.




Intended features:
- animals reproduction
- fight between animal species
- memory of other creatures, water spots, etc.
- eventually ... evolution (that was the first goal of this project)
